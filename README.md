# QCaaS
Ocean data Quality Control as a Service prototype exploration project.

This project contains source and resources for a prototype web services-based data QC checking system.

#### Organization
The project has 3 main components: 
 -  server : Server-side Web Service endpoint that invokes the external server-side Quality Control routines 
 -  client : Client-side proxy that invokes the Web Service.
 -  common : Java files used by both client and server, primarily request and response messages and elements.

Additional components include a test web server to run the Web Services for testing, as well as a test client to drive
test invocations.

#### Files
In general, please refrain from committing IDE- or local environment-specific files and configuration.

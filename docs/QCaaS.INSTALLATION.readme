Port(s) : 
	conf/server.xml :
		main listening port: line 69 (currently) :     <Connector port="8573" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
			can change 8573 to whatever desired
		shutdown port : line 22 (currently) : <Server port="8575" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
			used to signal server shutdown
	bin/debug + bin/setenv.sh
		JPDA (remote debug connection) port : 8501
		Should only be in one place, but if you don't use bin/debug to start, it wouldn't be properly set.

URL: http[s]://<hostname>:<port>//<servlet_path>/<context_path>/<application_path>/<test_name>
eg : http://matisse:8573/qcaas/ws/qc/range

Servlet path: [qccas]
	webapps/<war_name>.war
	webapps/qcaas.war
		If extra levels necessary, add path levels separated by # : webapps/<lvl0#lvl1[...]>.war

Context Path: [ws]
	webapps/<war_name>/WEB-INF/web.xml

Application Path: [qc]
	hard-coded : gov.noaa.pmel.qcaas.ws.QcServiceResource

Script location:
	default: [tomcat-install-root]/content/qcaas/bin

QCaaS configuration properties files: content/qcaas/config
	The main thing that needs to be specified is the test name -> script mapping
	as qcaas.qc.script.<test_name>=<script_name>

	Typically this would be specified either in machine- or environment-specific config file.

	see README.config for configuration system information.

Customizations:
	Added webapps/ROOT/403.html, 404.html, error.html, index.html
	to remove Tomcat defaults to now reveal tomcat version
	MUST also update conf/web.xml to make mappings

Tomcat manager app:
	GUI manager app is available at http://localhost:<port>/manager/html
	(Normally accessible from root path, but no longer with above index.html replacement.)
	Currently only accessible from localhost. If you need remote access, 
	you will have to specify remote host IP address in the webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml Valve.

	username/password specified in [tomcat]/conf/tomcat-users.xml

Startup: either:
	$ bin/startup.sh  - normal operation
		> bin/startup.bat - windows
	$ bin/debug - debug operation : available for Java Remote Debugging connection
		> no windows version  yet.  Just have to create a bin/debug.bat file.

This project uses lombok (https://projectlombok.org)

Lombok provides a lot of annotation-driven code generation.

To enable lombok annotations:

- In general, see the install section on the project lombok website.

NOTE that I have only done this with Eclipse on mac.

In Eclipse:  double-click on dev-libs/lombok.jar 
In IntelliJ: install the lombok plugin. It comes bundled in later versions.
